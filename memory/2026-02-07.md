# 2026-02-07 - Memory Log

## Project: MAD SNIPER (Memecoins Are Dead - Social Narrative Emitter)
Hackathon Project

### GitHub Repository
- **Repo:** https://github.com/mememan-anon/mad-sniper-hackathon
- **Status:** Active development
- **Location:** /home/node/.openclaw/workspace-main/mad-sniper-hackathon

### Day 1 ✅ (Pushed to GitHub)
- Project structure created
- Planner module implemented
- Logger module implemented
- CLI entry point created
- **Successfully pushed to main branch**

### Day 2 ✅ (Completed, not yet pushed)
- Browser automation module (Puppeteer)
- Action executor implemented
- Walrus client for decentralized storage
- Persistent logger
- Integration tests created
- **Issue:** Git repository has nested `.git` directory structure causing push conflicts

### Technical Issues Encountered
1. **Nested Git Repository:**
   - Problem: `.git` exists both in workspace-main and mad-sniper-hackathon subdirectory
   - This causes submodule conflicts and prevents pushing Day 2 work
   - Solution needed: Remove nested `.git` or reinitialize repository properly

### Agent Roles and Responsibilities

#### Planner Agent Responsibilities:
- Owns reasoning, interpretation of goals, and strategy.
- Breaks objectives into ordered, executable tasks.
- Defines acceptance criteria and constraints.
- Provides clear instructions to the Coder.

#### Coder Agent Responsibilities:
- Executes the tasks provided by the Planner.
- Performs implementation, coding, integrations, and mechanical operations.
- May make minor technical adjustments required for execution (formatting, syntax, dependency fixes).

#### Coder Limitations:
- Must not change product direction, architecture, or objectives.
- Must not invent new features or workflows.
- Must not override constraints defined by the Planner.
- If the Coder detects ambiguity, conflict, or impossibility:
  → Pause execution.
  → Ask the Planner for clarification.

#### Authority Structure:
- Planner = decision authority.
- Coder = execution authority.
